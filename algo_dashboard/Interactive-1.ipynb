    "*   A simple moving average crossover strategy (40-day short window, 100-day long window) was implemented to generate trading signals.\n",
    "*   Backtesting with an initial capital of 100,000 INR resulted in a final portfolio value of 61,006.00 INR.\n",
    "*   The total profit/loss from the backtest was -38,994.00 INR, representing a percentage return of -38.99%.\n",

    "*   Visualizations were generated showing the portfolio value over time and the portfolio drawdown over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "*   The current moving average crossover strategy resulted in a significant loss during the backtesting period. Further optimization of the moving average window lengths or exploring different trading strategies is necessary.\n",
    "*   Implementing more sophisticated risk management techniques (e.g., stop-loss orders) and calculating additional performance metrics (e.g., Sharpe Ratio, max drawdown duration) would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the strategy.\n",
